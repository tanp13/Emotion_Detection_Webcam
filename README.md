# Emotion Detection with FER2013 Dataset

This project uses deep learning to detect emotions from facial images using the FER2013 dataset.

## Dataset
- **FER2013**: Not included in this repository due to size and copyright. Download it from [Kaggle FER2013 page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and place it in the appropriate directory (e.g., `FER2013/`).
- The dataset should have the following structure:
  ```
  FER2013/

      happy/
      neutral/
      sad/
      surprised/
  ```
